DatePro is a standard ZOO element, you can follow the [extending type](http://yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/extend-pre-build-types) guide to integrate the element into your existent Apps. Once the element is set in the Type there are several configuration params that do differ from the ZOO ones, lets see what is all that about.

The Basic set are ZOOlanders common [Configuration fields](/zoolanders/elements/fields#configuration). The Specific set are DatePro related fields.

| Field       | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| **Mode** | The date type, can be set as single Date or Event (date range). |
| **Time** | If enabled the date would allow inputing the time as well. |

## Assignment

The Element is set now but is not rendering at all, let's fix that. Assign the element to the position of your choice following the [assign elements](http://yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/assign-elements-to-layout-positions) guide. Once assigned there will be few other sets of fields requiring attention.

The Basic, Filter and Separator sets are ZOOlanders common [Assignment fields](/zoolanders/elements/fields#assignment). The Layout set displays the fields related to DatePro layouts, which is the topic of the next page.

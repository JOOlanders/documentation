# Getting Started

## Installation

1. Download the package from the [ZOOlanders Site](https://www.zoolanders.com).
2. Enter the _Joomla! Extension Manager_ and install it through the **Upload Package File** option.

> If you have issues with the installation try the alternative **Install from Directory** method. Upload the unzipped package content into the `/tmp` folder, input the folder path and click on the Install button.

::: tip
If your site is multilingual or the main language is not English, you may want to install the INI translation files for each language. Similarly as above, [download](http://static.zoolanders.com/translations/) and install the translation packages.

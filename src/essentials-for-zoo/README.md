# Getting Started

## Introduction

Essential Addons for ZOO is a set of features and enhancements for the [YOOtheme ZOO CCK](https://yootheme.com/zoo-joomla-cck). It provides premium addons for Joomla which full features set can be explored at the [ZOOlanders](https://www.zoolanders.com/essentials-for-zoo) site.

## Installation

1. Download the packages you need from the [ZOOlanders Site](https://www.zoolanders.com).
2. In your site go to _Joomla! Extension Manager_ and use the **Upload Package File** option to upload and install the downloaded package.

> If you have issues with the installation try the alternative **Install from Directory** method. Upload the unzipped package content into the `/tmp` folder, input the folder path and click on the Install button.

## Translation

You may want to install as well the INI translation files for all the languages your site should support. Similarly as in the previous section, [download the required translation packages](http://static.zoolanders.com/translations/) and install them using the _Joomla! Extension Manager_ or upload the files manually into the `administrator/language/{LANGUAGE}` folder.

> If a language is missing or incomplete, you can contribute to the translation at [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/joolanders/zoolanders/).

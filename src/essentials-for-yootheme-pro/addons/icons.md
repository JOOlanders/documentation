# Icons

This addon will extend the YOOtheme Pro Builder with new icon libraries like Font Awesome, Ionicons, and Zondicons. The icons will be accessible in the core icons Modal when choosing an icon for any element.

The default icons providers are stored at `plugins/system/yooessentials/modules/icons/icons` and `wp-content/plugins/yooessentials/modules/icons/icons` for Joomla and WordPress respectively. And you can set your own items providers at `media/yooessentials/icons` or `wp-content/yooessentials/icons`.

Additionally you can place a collection of icons only available for the current theme by placing them at `yootheme_{mychildtheme}/myicons`. Those will be availble in the Icons Modal under the `My Icons` tab. We encourage the use of My Icons as those will persist any changes from 3rd party icon providers.

::: tip
You can always opt to completely disable this features within the `Theme Settings::ZOOlanders` panel.

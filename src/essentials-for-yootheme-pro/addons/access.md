# Access

This addon will extend the YOOtheme Pro Builder with access rules for any element rendering. The rules will be accessible in the element Advanced settings as long as the element in question opt to include those.

The current list of rules is composed by `Date`, `User Access`, and `Languages`, but note that it is possible to add your own rules. Each rule has to be specifically enabled in which case an Access Icon will be displayed in the Builder warning about the potential affected rendering.

::: tip
You can always opt to completely disable this features within the `Theme Settings::ZOOlanders` panel.

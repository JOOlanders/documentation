# Getting Started

## Introduction

[Sources](https://zoolanders.com/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/sources) addon extends the YOOtheme Pro Builder with the ability to create sources for Dynamic Content, for example a CSV file, a Google Sheet or an Instagram Page.

## My First Source

Let's create the first source which later on can be used to map its contents to an element of your choice.

<video width="800" controls>
  <source src="./assets/configuration.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

1. **Create a New Source**. Enter the `Sources` Section and create a new one by clicking the *New Source* button. A modal will popup with a form.
2. **Set Up the Name**. Write a name for yor new source. This name will be used as a source reference displayed in the `Dynamic Content` selection list.
3. **Choose the Provider**. Choose one of the source provider, for this example, a CSV.
4. **Fulfil the Provider Options**. Each provider has its own options, the CSV provider requires to select a locally-stored CSV file.
5. **Save the Source**. After pressing `Save` on the modal the new source will appear listed.
6. **Bind the Source**. At this point the source content will be available for mapping it to an element. Follow the [official Yootheme docs](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content) for more details about it.

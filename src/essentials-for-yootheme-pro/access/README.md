# Getting Started

## Introduction

[Access](https://zoolanders.com/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/access) addon extends YOOtheme Pro builder elements with rendering conditions that will be evaluated against the logic and configuration set by extendable rules.

## First Condition

Let's create our first condition for an element to render.

<video width="800" controls>
  <source src="./assets/configuration.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

1. **Choose an Element**. Choose an element to which to apply a restriction. In it Advanced Tab settings, locate the Access field setting and enter the Configuration panel.

2. **Set a Condition**. In the configuration Panel enable one or more rules for the condition to be evaluated, eg. `Time`.

At this point the element should render, or not, depending on the current server time and the rule configuration.

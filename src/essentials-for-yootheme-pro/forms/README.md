# Getting Started

## Introduction

[Forms](https://zoolanders.com/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/forms) addon extends YOOtheme Pro builder with a form build and submission workflow, allowing for any `section` or `column` element to become a submittable Form Area with flexible fields and After Submit Actions.

## First Form

Let's create our first form which later on can be expanded as required.

<video width="800" controls>
  <source src="./assets/configuration.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

1. **Set a Form Area**. Choose a `section` or `column` element which will become a Form Area. In it element Advanced Tab settings, locate the Form field setting and enable it.

2. **Set After Submit Actions**. Once the Form Area is enabled a configuration panel will be available for it. Access that panel and add at least one After Submit Action, eg. `Message`, an action that will show a message in a modal.

3. **Set Form Fields**. Get back to the Builder main area and Drag & Drop at least one Input Field and a Submit Button in the Form Area you just set.

4. **Submit the Form!** At this point your form should be ready. Input some content and hit the Submit button. If the form was validated a Message Should display. If so, congratulations! Otherwise check the possible [Form Configuration Errors](./configuration.md#errors).

> While any element can be placed inside a Form Area only [Form Elements](./elements.md) will be processed during a submission.

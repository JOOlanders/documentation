# Getting Started

## Installation

Download the [YOOtheme Pro Essentials](https://www.zoolanders.com/downloads) package corresponding to the required platform, `_j3.zip` for Joomla or `_wp.zip` for WordPress. Install it by following the official [Joomla](https://docs.joomla.org/Installing_an_extension) or [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/) installation guide.

## Updates

YOOtheme Pro Essentials can be updated using the Joomla or WordPress 1-click update system. Whenever a new version is available, you will receive a notification in the platform extensions control panel.

Before being able to update the Premium version, you have to [get a ZOOlanders Download ID](https://www.zoolanders.com/download-ids) and set it in the `ZOOlanders Installer` plugin settings in Joomla or the `Settings::ZOOlanders` in WordPress.

Alternatively you can update using the Joomla Installer method the same way as explained in the the Installation step. Unfortunately in WordPress that is not possible.

> Even if technically is possible to update through FTP, we strongly discourage this method as possible update scripts will be omited resulting on unexpected behaviours.

## Changelog

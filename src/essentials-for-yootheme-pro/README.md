## Updating

Whenever a new version is available, you will receive a notification in the `Joomla Extensions Update` or `WordPress Plugins` control panel. Within it, you can easily update with a one-click action.

> Before being able to update the Premium version, you will have to set your [ZOOlanders Download ID](#download-id).

::: warning Don't upload by FTP
Even if technically possible, we strongly discourage this method as update scripts will be omitted, resulting in unexpected outcomes.

### Download ID

A ZOOlanders Download ID is an alphanumeric code created in the [ZOOlanders Download IDs section](https://www.zoolanders.com/download-ids) that is required to update the Premium version. If you are using the Free version you can skip these steps.

Once you have created and copied a Download ID you are ready to set it in your site. Note that you can create as many IDs as necessary.

#### Joomla

In the Joomla Plugins Control Panel find the ZOOlanders Installer plugin, access its settings, and paste the Download ID into the field.

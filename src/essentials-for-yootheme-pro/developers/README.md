Essential Addons for YOOtheme Pro uses best practices when extending YOOtheme Pro, becoming in an essence a core feature. That means that if you know how to extend YOOtheme Pro, you know how to extend the Addons. If you don't, we invite you to visit the Yootheme Pro [Developers Guide](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/modules-and-events) first.

The Addons are composed of YOOtheme Pro modules encapsulated into a [plugin](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/) named _yooessentials_. The plugin is located at `plugins/system/yooessentials` in Joomla and `wp-content/plugins/yooessentials` in WordPress.

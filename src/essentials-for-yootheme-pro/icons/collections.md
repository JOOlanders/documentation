# Collections

## Core Collections

Icons collections are provided under a common folder, with optional sub folders as groups, stored in:

- Joomla: `plugins/system/yooessentials/modules/icons/icons`
- WordPress: `wp-content/plugins/yooessentials/modules/icons/icons`

TODO: You can add custom collections, learn how.

### FontAwesome

### Teenyicons

## My Icons

My Icons is a special collection restricted to the current [Child Theme](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/child-themes) which would become available under the `My Icons` tab in the icons picker Modal. It icons are expected under the `{MyChildThemeDir}/myicons` directory and is our recommendation to keep project-related icons safe and organized.

::: tip
You can group the icons into subfolders, eg `{MyChildThemeDir}/myicons/group-a` or `{MyChildThemeDir}/myicons/group-b`.

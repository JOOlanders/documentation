# Collections

Icons collections are a set of preset or custom icons under a common topic. A collection might be grouped into subsections. This addon distributes the following collections:

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Licensed under GPL

  The most popular and complete icon collection, offering a Free and Pro versions.

- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) - Licensed under MIT

  Beautifully crafted open source icons built by the Ionic Framework team.

- [Teenyicons](https://teenyicons.com/) - Licensed under Creative Commons

  Designed on a 15x15 grid, Teenyicons easily fit in very small spaces and maintain a crisp look.

- [Zondicons](https://zondicons.com/) - Licensed under Creative Commons

  A collection of icons with charming yet sophisticated personality designed by Steve Schoger.

::: tip
The preset collections are a good start, but you can always extend them with your [own collections](./howto.md#set-a-custom-collection), eg. your FontAwesome Pro collection.

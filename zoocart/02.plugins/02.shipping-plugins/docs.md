**Shipping Plugins** process the shipping calculations during the checkout and the shipping itself after the payment has been processed. There are several available by default and you can choose which one to use by enable/disabling them in the **Joomla! Plugin Manager**, where you would also find any shipping related setting.

* Standard
* USPS

>>> If you miss some and end up creating a custom plugin that you are willing to share with the community, make a pull request updating the list.

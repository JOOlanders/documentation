Once **ZOOlingual** is installed all ZOO elements will have a new section available in the configuration for language managing. It allows to set on which language/s that specific element will be displayed, falling back to all if none selected.

The language can be set on the element **Configuration** and/or **Assignment** allowing to set a base restriction in the Configuration and override it in the layout positions assignment. This powerful feature is specially handy when dealing with number/date values elements, like a Birthday, which value requires no translation, but rather display localization; assigning the element on the same position once for each language and adjusting its display options for it, will do the trick!

## Content

For those elements that do require a translation we would duplicate it for each language and set that specific language in the Element Configuration. That way, that element becomes language specific and we can start inputing the translated content right away while editing the Items as usual.

>>>>> ZOOlingual will automatically add **Name, Alias, Meta Title, Meta Description** and other related inputs in the **Items/Categories** Content Tab in order to allow translating core fields.

## Language Switcher

ZOOlingual does not provide its own language switcher, instead relies on the Joomla! inbuilt one or 3rd party language managers. For more info on setting a multi-lingual site with Joomla! check this [guide](http://help.joomla.org/files/EN-GB_multilang_tutorial.pdf).

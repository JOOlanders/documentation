* **Does ZOOlingual translates Joomla! content?** <br /> No, ZOOlingual focus only on ZOO content and relies on Joomla! or 3rd party language managers for the the general Joomla! content translation.

* **Where is the language swither?** <br /> There is none provided by ZOOlingual, instead you must set the Joomla! or 3rd party one.

* **Why an Item view is redirected to a Category view when swithing language?** <br /> Joomla! language switcher has this limitation. The only solution would be using some 3rd party language manager instead which solves it.

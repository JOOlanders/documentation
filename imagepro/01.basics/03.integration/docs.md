ImagePro is a standard ZOO element, you can follow the [extending type](http://yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/extend-pre-build-types) guide to integrate the element into your existent Apps. Once the element is set in the Type there are several configuration params that do differ from the ZOO ones, lets see what is all that about.

The Basic and Files sets are ZOOlanders common [Configuration fields](/zoolanders/elements/fields#configuration). The Specific set are ImagePro related fields.

| Field       | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| **Custom Options** | If enabled the extra input fields be we displayed on the Edit view. |
| **Title** | Toggles the **title** field. |
| **Link** | Toggles the **link** field. |
| **Lightbox** | Toggles the **lightbox** field. |
| **Overlay** | Toggles the **overlay** field. |

## Assignment

The Element is set now but is not rendering at all, let's fix that. Assign the element to the position of your choice following the [assign elements](http://yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/assign-elements-to-layout-positions) guide. Once assigned there will be few other sets of fields requiring attention.

The Basic, Filter and Separator sets are ZOOlanders common [Assignment fields](/zoolanders/elements/fields#assignment). The Layout set displays the fields related to ImagePro layouts, which is the topic of the next page.

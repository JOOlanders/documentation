* **"Where can be set the default Items ordering for the Category view?** - It is configured in the application settings.

* **Is it possible to set ordering of items within one category?** - ZOOorder allows to add the module to the category page where you can specify the ordering params for this category.

* **Why the ordering of numbers is not correct? (E.g. 700 is higher than 1000)** - Please make sure that the Element has the correct Value Type (e.g. Numerical). You can check it in the ZOOorder Layout settings.
 
* **Is it possible to setup ordering by several elements at one time?** - No, it's currently not supported.

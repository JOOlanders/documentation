* **Where the default ordering of items on the Category view is set?** - It is configured in the application settings.

* **Is it possible to set ordering of items within one category?** - ZOOorder allows to add the module to the category page where you can specify the ordering params for this category.

* **Why the ordering of numbers is not correct? (E.g. 700 is higher than 1000)** - Please make sure that the Element has the correct Value Type (e.g. Numerical). You can check it in the ZOOorder Layout settings.

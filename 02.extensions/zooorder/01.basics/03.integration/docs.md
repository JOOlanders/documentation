Once **ZOOorder** is installed it will become available as a Joomla! module ready to be assigned to any template position. Being only possible ordering Items from the same Type/App at a time, you would need to choose those in the Module params and make sure to be rendered on the App Teaser views. The available options are:

| Field       | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| **Type** | The ZOO App/Type that the ordering will be applied to. |
| **Layout** | The Layout to use for the ordering fields mapping. |
| **Module Layout** | The layout that will be used to display the module. |
| **Module Class Suffix** | A module class suffix for specific module styling. |

## Layout Setup

Configure the ZOOorder layout by assigning elements to a rendering positions. 

>>> More information about Element assigning can be found at [ZOO documentation](http://yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/assign-elements-to-layout-positions).

For correct ordering select the corrsponding **Value Type** in the ZOOorder layout Basic settings. Among the options are *Alphabetical*, *Numerical*, *Numerical with decimals* and *By Date*.

* **Can ZOOaccess manage access to ZOO Items and/or ZOO Categories?** <br /> No, currently ZOOaccess only provides Elements access restrictions.

* **How to restrict access to the element only in a certain layout? (for example, Submission)** <br /> The base access restriction can be set on the Element Configuration. Then you can override (change) it for the needed Layout in the Layout Positions Assignment. Select the "Override" checkbox and specify the evaluation rule only for this Layout.

* **Can ZOOaccess override ZOO core settings?** <br /> No, instead use ZOOaccess rules to set base restrictions on the Element Configuration and override it in the Layout Positions Assignment.

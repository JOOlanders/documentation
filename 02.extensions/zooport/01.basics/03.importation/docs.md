When importing ZOO data there are two supported formats, **JSON** and **CSV**, both are executed the same way, through the ZOO App Config **Import/Export** section.

## Import JSON

Select the file using the **JSON** import form and click on the import button in order to start the assistant. In the next view you can choose if the **Frontpage** and **Categories** should be imported and map the elements for each one of the imported Types.

* **Does the standard ZOO Import/Export support ZOOlanders elements?"** - No, this is currently unsupported. 

* **Is an option "Import from installed software : Joomla / K2" supported?** - CSV import is supported, if the software allows to export the data in CSV. JSON import supports only JSON files generated by ZOOport, due to the specific format. 

* **What should be the date format in a CSV file?** - The correct date format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. If a CSV file won't import, please make sure you are using the correct date format.

* **Is it possible to import multiple Select element values?** - Yes, it is possible with CSV import. All possible options should be specified in the Select element settings. In the CSV file should be a separate column for each option, which is equal to the options' Values, not Names. 

* **How to import items as Pulished / Searchable / Frontpage?** - In the CSV file add columns "State" / "Searchable" / "Frontpage" with the values "1" or "true" - if "Yes", and "0" or "false" - if "No". Then during Assign Element step assign them to the Core Attributes fields.

* **Why ZOOport wont import or import not correct symbols?* - The file to import should be UTF-8 encoded.

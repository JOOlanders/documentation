* **Does the standard ZOO Import/Export support ZOOlanders elements?"** - No, this is currently unsupported. 

* **Is an option "Import from installed software : Joomla / K2" supported?** - CSV import is supported, if the software allows to export the data in CSV. JSON import supports only JSON files generated by ZOOport, due to the specific format. 

* **What should be the date format in a CSV file?** - The correct date format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. If a CSV file won't import, please make sure you are using the correct date format.

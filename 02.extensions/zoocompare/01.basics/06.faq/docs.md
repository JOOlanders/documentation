* **Is possible to upgrade from ZOOcompare 2 to 3?** <br /> Due to the big changes made in ZOOcompare 3 the upgrade process is not possible, instead a clean installation must be performed uninstalling any previous version. The comparison settings will be lost during this process, be sure to back up your data before proceeding.

* **Is cross App/Type searching supported?** <br /> No, the current version of ZOOfilter can only perform a search on one App and Type at the same time. It is possible however to display several Modules with different configurations in the same page.

* **Is one field search supported?** <br /> No, the current version of ZOOfilter can only filter the Items by their elements values individually. Making a global search is planned for future revisions.

* **Where the ordering of items on the results page can be changed?** <br /> ZOOfilter inherits ordering from the application default ordering, that you can setup in the application settings: Config tab / Configuration(Global) / Item Order. Please note that it will affect the ordering of items in the application as well.

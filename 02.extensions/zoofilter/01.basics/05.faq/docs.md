* **Is cross App/Type searching supported?** <br /> No, the current version of ZOOfilter can only perform a search on one App and Type at the same time. It is possible however to display several Modules with different configurations in the same page.

* **Is one field search supported?** <br /> No, the current version of ZOOfilter can only filter the Items by their elements values individually. Making a global search is planned for future revisions.

* **Where the ordering of items on the results page can be changed?** <br /> ZOOfilter uses the application default ordering, that you can setup in the application settings: Config tab / Configuration(Global) / Item Order. Please note that it will affect the ordering of items in the application as well. After the ZOOfilter result is shown, it is possible to use the ordering that is setup in ZOOfilter [Ordring layout](/extensions/zoofilter/basics/integration#results-ordering).

* **How to search by RelatedCategoriesPro element?** <br /> RelatedCategoriesPro element is not compatible with ZOOfilter. Instead the standard Category element could be used if the option "Relate to Item" is enabled in the RelatedCategoriesPro element settings.

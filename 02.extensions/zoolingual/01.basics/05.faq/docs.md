* **Does ZOOlingual translates Joomla! content?** <br /> No, ZOOlingual focus only on ZOO content and relies on Joomla! or 3rd party language managers for the the general Joomla! content translation.

* **Where is the language swit—Åher?** <br /> There is none provided by ZOOlingual, instead you must set the Joomla! or 3rd party one.

* **Why an Item view is redirected to a Category view when switching language?** <br /> Joomla! language switcher has this limitation. The only solution would be using some 3rd party language manager instead which solves it.

* **Where can I set the list of languages available in ZOOlingual?** <br /> All content languages, that are set in *Joomla / Extensions / Language Manager / Content tab*, will be available in ZOOlingual section in the element configuration.

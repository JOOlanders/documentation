title: Translation through Submission

Generally, ZOOlingual doesn't support translation through Submission. 
But there is a trick to make it work. You can remove the language restriction from the element settings in the Submission layout (override the ZOOlingual settings for the element on the layout settings), so all elements will be displayed. 
Then develop and apply some workaround for hiding the unnecessary element(s) (for example, if you know the elements identifiers for each language, you can hide them using JS and/or CSS).

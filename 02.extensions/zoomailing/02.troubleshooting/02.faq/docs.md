* **It is possible to send an automatic Newsletter whenever a new ZOO Item is published?** - ZOOmailing does not manage the newsletters schedule, but you can set AcyMailing to send a Newsletter every day with ZOOmailing tag that will retrieve the items by its **published** or **created** date. If there are no items matching the criteria, no Newsletter will be send.

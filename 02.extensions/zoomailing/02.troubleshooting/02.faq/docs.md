* **It is possible to send an automatic Newsletter whenever a new ZOO Item is published?** - ZOOmailing does not manage the newsletters schedule, but you can set AcyMailing to send a Newsletter every day with ZOOmailing tag that will retrieve the items by its **created** or **modified** date (currently **published** date is not supported). If there are no items matching the criteria, no Newsletter will be send.

* **I have inserted the tag, but there are no items in the newsletter. Why?** - One of the possible reasons is that the ZOOmailing layout is not configured. You can do so in ZOO Type settings view.

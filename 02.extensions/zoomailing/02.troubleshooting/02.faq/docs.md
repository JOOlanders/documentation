1. **Is it possible whenever a new Zoo item is published it will automatically send out a newsletter with the updated content?** - ZOOmailing is used only for rendering content, it cannot manage the newsletters schedule. But you can configure to send emails every day with ZOOmailing tag that get items by published_date or created_date. If there are no published or created items since yesterday no emails will be sent.

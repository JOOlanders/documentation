* **Why doesn't metadata load on the Item page?** - Please make sure that ZOOseo plugin is enabled and setup, and "ZOOseo Metadata Item" layout is configured.

* **Is ZOOseo compatible with other Joomla! SEO extensions?** - Yes, ZOOseo extension works with any Joomla! SEO extensions. They are complementary and work together.

* **Is it possible to set Open Graph meta information for a ZOO Category page?** - No, currently Open Graph meta tags can be applied only to ZOO Item pages.

* **Does ZOOseo solve the problem with duplicated content?** - No, it is not a scope of ZOOseo plugin. To solve this problem ZOO sets the canoninal URL for an item. ZOOseo only prevents duplicating content by redirecting from URL with segments `/item` or `/category`to a new one (without segments).

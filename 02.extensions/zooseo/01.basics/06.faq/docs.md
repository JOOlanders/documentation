* **Why doesn't metadata load on the Item page?** - Please make sure that ZOOseo plugin is enabled and setup, and "ZOOseo Metadata Item" layout is configured.

* **Is ZOOseo compatible with other Joomla! SEO extensions?** - Yes, ZOOseo extension works with any Joomla! SEO extensions. They are complementary and work together.

* **Is it possible to set Open Graph meta information for a ZOO Category page?** - Currently Open Graph meta tags can be applied only to ZOO Item pages.

* **Does ZOOseo solve the problem with duplicated content?** - No, it is not a scope of ZOOseo plugin. To solve this problem ZOO sets the canoninal URL for an item. ZOOseo only has an option that prevents duplicating content by redirecting from URL with segment `/item` or `/category`to the new ones (without segments).

* **Does ZOOcart generate Invoices?** <br /> No, that's not store scope but 3rd party integrations will be developed in the future. Alternatively, and in some countries, the **Order** print version is a valid document which the user can access under the **Print** button in the **Orders** view.

* **Where can I find ZOOcart Admin Panel?** <br /> In ZOOlanders component Nav Menu, make sure ZOOcart plugin is enabled.

* **Is it possible to specify the gross price instead of the net price, so that ZOOcart calculates net prices automatically?"** <br /> Currently you can specify only the net price. Option "Show price and fees with tax" allows to display the item price with tax (gross price) or price without tax (net price).  Feature "Save price with included taxes" is planned for one of ZOOcart future releases (no planned date).

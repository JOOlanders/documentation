* **Does ZOOcart generate Invoices?** <br /> No, that's not store scope but 3rd party integrations will be developed in the future. Alternatively, and in some countries, the **Order** print version is a valid document which the user can access under the **Print** button in the **Orders** view.

* **Where can I find ZOOart Admin Panel?** <br /> In ZOOlanders component Nav Menu, make sure ZOOcart plugin is enabled.

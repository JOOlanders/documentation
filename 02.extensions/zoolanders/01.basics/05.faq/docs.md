* **What does mean the OpenSSL error on the Extensions Manager?** <br /> ZOOlanders Manager establishes a connection with zoolanders.com server using OpenSSL, but the version installed in your server is vulnerable and unsupported. It is highly recommended to update your server OpenSSL extension to the latest version in order to fix this and possible other issues you may come around. Contact your hosting support for further help about it.

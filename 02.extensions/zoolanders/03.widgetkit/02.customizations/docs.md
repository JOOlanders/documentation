## Custom Widget Layouts

Widgetkit2 integration has no rendering layouts, instead only the content is passed to the Widget which will render it using its core layouts. It's possible to customize the Widgets, though, by following [the official guide](http://yootheme.com/widgetkit/documentation/customizing/custom-widget-plugin).

## Custom Mapping Layout

It's usually not necessary but in case you want to customize the Mapping layouts positions those are placed in `plugins/system/widgetkit_zl/plugin/renderer/item` folder. You should add the custom layouts there, that folder will not be overwritten by updates.

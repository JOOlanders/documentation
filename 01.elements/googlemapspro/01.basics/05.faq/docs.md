* **Why Widgetkit 1 is not recognizing GoogleMapsPro locations?** <br /> Widgetkit 1 Map Widget will not recognize  GoogleMapsPro values, as a solution download and install the **ZL Widget Plugin** available in the GoogleMapsPro [downloads](http://www.zoolanders.com/extensions/google-maps-pro). Once installed and enabled create a new ZL Map widget and use it instead. **Notice** that this is not necessary if you are using Widgetkit 2.
* **Why I receive an error "Geocode was not successful for the following reason: REQUEST_DENIED"?** <br /> Activate Google Maps Static API and Google Maps Geocoding API in the Google developer console.

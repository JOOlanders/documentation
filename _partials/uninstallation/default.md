You have **two** ways for uninstalling the extension, the first and easier one is the 1-click uninstall process with **ZOOlanders Extension Manager**, the other way is through the **Joomla! Extension Manager**.

## Option 1: with ZOOlanders Manager

1. In your site, locate the extension entry in the ZOOlanders Manager extensions list
2. Click on its Uninstall button

## Option 2: with Joomla! Manager

1. In your site, go to Joomla! Extension Manager and access the Manage section from the left Menu.
2. Localize the Extension you are searching for and press the top **Uninstall** button once selected.

>>>> If you are uninstalling an element don't use this method as it would delete all ZOOlanders elements. Instead use the ZOOlanders Manager or proceed manually by deleting its folder from `plugins/system/zoo_zlelements/zoo_zlelements/elements` directory.

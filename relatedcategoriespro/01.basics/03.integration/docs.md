RelatedCategoriesPro is a standard ZOO element, you can follow the [extending type](http://yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/extend-pre-build-types) guide to integrate the element into your existent Apps. Once the element is set in the Type there are several configuration params that do differ from the ZOO ones, lets see what is all that about.

The Basic set are ZOOlanders common [Configuration fields](/zoolanders/elements/fields#configuration). The Specific and Item sets are RelatedCategoriesPro related fields.

| Field       | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| **Multiselect** | Allows choosing if the category selection should be limited to one or multiple categories. |
| **Relate to Item** | Allows choosing if the Selected Categories should be actually related to the Item. This feature is limited to the Categories that are part of the same App the Item is. |
| **App** | Allows choosing the App which Categories will be displayed as relating options. |
| **Root Category** | Allows choosing the root category which childs will be displayed as relating options. |

## Assignment

The Element is set now but is not rendering at all, let's fix that. Assign the element to the position of your choice following the [assign elements](http://yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/assign-elements-to-layout-positions) guide. Once assigned there will be another set of fields requiring attention.

The Basic, Filter and Separator sets are ZOOlanders common [Assignment fields](/zoolanders/elements/fields#assignment).The Layout set displays the fields related to RelatedCategoriesPro layouts, which is the topic of the next page.

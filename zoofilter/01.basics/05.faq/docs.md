* **Is cross App/Type searching supported?** <br /> No, the current version of ZOOfilter can only perform a search on one App and Type at the same time. It is possible however to display several Modules with different configurations in the same page.
* **Is one field search supported?** <br /> No, the current version of ZOOfilter can only filter the Items by their elements values individually. Making a global search is planned for future revisions.

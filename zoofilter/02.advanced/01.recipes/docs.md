## Menu Assignment

There is a case when you would like to display a pre-filtered list of Items without allowing further filtering.

1. Following the integration guide setup the search form.
2. Perform the desired filtering and then copy the URL of the result page.
3. Add a new Joomla! **External URL** Menu Item.
4. In the link address area paste the **URL** that you just copied.
5. Optionally remove the ZOOfilter Module created in step 1.

When accessing the new created **View** the list of pre-filtered Items should be displayed.
